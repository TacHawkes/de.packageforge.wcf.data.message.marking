Mark Team Members 1.0
===============================

This package appends the wcf and the wcf profile package with functionality for marking team messages. 
It is a package only. It does nothing with an additional plugin which uses the functionality provided 
by this package.

Version notes
-------------

The current version is a beta version and can still contain serious bugs or errors. Use with caution!

Contribution
------------

Every developer is welcome to provide bug fixes or enhancements. The usual WCF code style rules apply (taken and modified from the WCF 2.0 readme):

* Testing is key, you MUST try out your changes before submitting pull requests
* You MUST save your files with Unix-style line endings (\n)
* You MUST NOT include the closing tag of a PHP block at the end of file, provide an empty newline instead
* You MUST use tabs for indentation
    * Tab size of 8 is required
    * Empty lines MUST be indented equal to previous line
* All comments within source code MUST be written in English language

Follow the above conventions if you want your pull requests accepted.
